Autoconf

Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell
scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a
configuration script for a package from a template file that lists the
operating system features that the package can use, in the form of M4
macro calls.

This disconnected branch holds scripts for “continuous integration” of
Autoconf, together with Automake and Libtool.  If you are _using_ Autoconf
in the development of your own code, you do not need to use these scripts
or even know they exist.  If you are doing development of Autoconf itself,
you can use these scripts to help you test your changes.  We are working
on setting up a server that will run these scripts automatically on every
commit to the main branches.

Licensing
=========
Autoconf is released under the General Public License version 3 (GPLv3+).
Autoconf itself includes a licensing exception in some of its source files,
but this exception does not apply to the scripts on this branch.

GNU Project notice
==================
Autoconf is part of the GNU Operating System, developed by the GNU Project.
