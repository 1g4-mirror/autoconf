* Status

	/*---------------------------------.
	| Don't use at all, just test it.  |
	`---------------------------------*/


* Serious bugs

Autoconf must not be used in production if there are serious bugs.

** Unexpanded macros
Some macros are left unexpanded (grep AS_MESSAGE configure), and
worse, autoconf doesn't complain.

** AC_LANG vs AC_REQUIRE
Because AC_REQUIRE makes the `time' concept different for Sh and M4,
it may happen that the currently required language is not the one
currently set.
