This file lists the bugs you must be aware of.  Be sure to check this
file before using Autoconf, and especially CVS versions of Autoconf.

Autoconf must not be used in production if there are ``Serious'' bugs,
and use with caution an Autoconf with ``Important bugs''.

Many other bugs are registered on the GNATS server:

Please, don't register bugs listed below: we already know we have to
address them.

* Status

	/*------------.
	| Don't use.  |
	`------------*/

* Serious Problems

** Broken compilers

configure does not properly diagnose broken compilers (because it
finds the failure before the code that checks whether the compiler
works).  It is not to serious a bug, but most notably the test suite
will fail to handle gracefully missing compilers (typically the
Fortran compiler).

** Special characters and config.hin

The handling of special characters, most notable backslashes, of
course, might be nonportable in addition of being of clearly
specified.

** AC_TRY_EVAL of multi line commands

Is broken.
