Autoconf must not be used in production if there are ``Serious'' bugs,
and use with caution an Autoconf with ``Important bugs''.

* Status

                 /*------------------------------------.
                 | New features need further testing.  |
                 `------------------------------------*/

* Now that configure depends on shell functions, it is possible that
  configure scripts may fail to run on old platforms that lack a shell
  with proper function support.

* Cygwin has known problems with named fifos that cause failures when
  attempting parallel tests in an autotest suite.  It is possible that
  other platforms also have difficulty with parallel testing.
