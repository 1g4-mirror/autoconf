This file lists the bugs you must be aware of.  Be sure to check this
file before using Autoconf, and especially CVS versions of Autoconf.

Autoconf must not be used in production if there are ``Serious'' bugs,
and use with caution an Autoconf with ``Important bugs''.

Many other bugs are registered on the GNATS server:

Please, don't register bugs listed below: we already know we have to
address them.

* Serious Problems

** Broken compilers

configure does not properly diagnose broken compilers (because it
finds the failure before the code that checks whether the compiler
works).  It is not to serious a bug, but most notably the test suite
will fail to handle gracefully missing compilers (typically the
Fortran compiler).

** Special characters and config.hin

The handling of special characters, most notable backslashes, of
course, might be nonportable in addition of being of clearly
specified.

** AC_TRY_EVAL of multi line commands

Is broken.  The problem is mostly that, again, the policy wrt special
characters is not clearly defined.  Because of this,
_AC_INIT_PREPARE_FS_SEPARATORS will output undesired messages, but is
not guilty.

./configure: /home/lrde/prof/akim/src/ace/tests; conftest.sh: Aucun fichier ou répertoire de ce type

AC_TRY_COMMAND is.

** AC_CHECK_PROG

and all the macros that use it, are paying the change for test -f to
test -x to determine whether a candidate path is an executable: now we
have false positives with directories which, indeed, are test -x.
