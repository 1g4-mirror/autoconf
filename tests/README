This directory holds the M4sugar, M4sh and Autoconf test suites.

Here are a few rules on how to write tests.

* Autoconf

** Use of `exit'
Don't directly `exit 1' or `exit 77', rather use `AC_MSG_ERROR'.
First of all because when we have to read the test suite logs we are
happy to know why `configure' exited thanks to the error
message. Secondly, because `configure' traps the `exit' and pretty
many shells fail to set $? to 77 when trapping `exit 77'.  This
results in the test suite not being able to check the exit status.

** AC_MSG_ERROR
Of course, since macro names are forbidden in `configure', if you
really want to mention the macro name, you'll have to do without
including `A?_' in the output.
