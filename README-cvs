These notes intend to help people working on the CVS version of
this package.

* Requirements

It is suggested that you build with the latest stable versions of the
maintainer tools we depend upon, including:

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Gzip <http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/>
- Help2man <http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/>
- M4 <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
- Tar <http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/>

Autoconf is built with itself, so you may have bootstrapping issues
when building from CVS.  You might try to install a recent snapshot
of Autoconf (after installing the above tools), and then use that.

Only building the initial full source tree will be a bit painful,
later, a plain `cvs update -P && make' should be sufficient.

Enjoy!
